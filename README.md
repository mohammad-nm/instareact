This project has been built by Next.js and uses SupaBase for authentication and Database.

The point of the project is to show my skills in developing a fully functional web application using Next.js, React, 

TypeScript and TailwindCSS.

All things are designed and developed by myself so it may look a liitle not professional but it works!! so its GOOD ENOUGH certified!

  run these commands in the project directory:
    1. npm install
    2. npm run dev
  and then go to the address localhost:3000 in your browser
